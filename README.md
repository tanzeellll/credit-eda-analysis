# credit-eda-analysis
My very first data science project studying at IIIT-B.  In this assignment, apart from applying the techniques that I had learnt in the EDA module, I also got to develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
